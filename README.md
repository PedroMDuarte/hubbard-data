## Numerical calculations of the 3D Fermi-Hubbard model

Here I present code to clean up and prepare a dataset of calculated
thermodynamic quantities in the homogeneous 3D Fermi-Hubbard model.  The data
was calculated by Thereza Paiva using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
and by Ehsan Khatami using the numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE). 

The cleaned up version of the dataset generated here is ready to be used in the
implementation of the local density approximation (LDA).  The implementation
code for the LDA can be found at https://github.com/PedroMDuarte/hubbard-lda3/ .
